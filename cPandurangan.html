                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Algorithmic thinking is a specialized way of thinking about problem solving by using a computer.
                    While mathematical thinking is the starting point for any meaningful problem solving, algorithmic
                    thinking differs from it is several subtle ways. There are several interesting ways to understand
                    the subtilities and puzzles and paradoxes are among key strategies for obtaining right insight.
                    Puzzles and paradoxes have the appeal that it can be discussed without any specialized knowledge of
                    any of the mathematical branches such as number theory or graph theory and yet will slowly take you
                    to the depths of understanding deeper mathematics. Hence this style of discussions. The pre
                    requisites are pen, paper and enthusiasm and perhaps a bit lighter lunch!!!!!!
